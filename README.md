## Download pictures of BNK48 member

A good friend of me is completely crazy about BNK48.

So I write a program that goes to [bnk48 website](https://www.bnk48.com/index.php?page=members) and downloads all the pictures of each member
And also names the pictures by that member's name.

The library using in this project

- [request](https://github.com/request/request) and [request-promise](https://github.com/request/request#promises--asyncawait) is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http or https calls.
- [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js.
